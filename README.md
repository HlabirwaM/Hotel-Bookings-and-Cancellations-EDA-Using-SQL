# Hlabirwa's SQL Projects Repository

Hello and thank you for visiting my repository! Here, I share various SQL projects where I've applied my skills to analyze publicly available datasets from Kaggle. Below are some of the interesting projects that showcase my proficiency in SQL, covering tasks from creating tables to conducting exploratory data analysis.
Projects Overview:

## 1) Hotel Bookings and Cancellation Analysis

In this project, I leverage my SQL and data analysis skills to perform exploratory data analysis on a simulated hotel named AB11, utilizing data from Kaggle provided by Youssef Aboelwafa. The primary objective is to gain insights into the booking and cancellation patterns of clients.

### Key Highlights:

 *  Table Creation: I start the project by creating the bookings table in PostgreSQL pgAdmin, setting the foundation for subsequent analyses.
 *  Data Exploration: The analysis dives into various aspects, including identifying months with the highest booking and cancellation activities.
 *  Room and Meal Preferences: I explore preferences for room types and meal options among hotel clients.
 *  Client Data Updates:
 *  The project covers updating client data and identifying loyal customers who might be eligible for incentives.

### Demonstrated Skills:

 *   Competency in key SQL query commands
 *   Exploration of complex datasets to extract meaningful insights.

### PowerBI Dashboard:
 *  For enhanced visualization, I have created a PowerBI Dashboard, available on novypro. The dashboard complements the SQL analysis by providing a visual representation of the data.

Feel free to explore the SQL analysis, review the PowerBI Dashboard, and reach out for discussions and comments. Your feedback is highly appreciated!
