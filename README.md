# Hlabirwa's SQL Projects Repository

Hello and thank you for visiting my repository! Here, I share various SQL projects where I've applied my skills to analyze publicly available datasets from Kaggle. Below are some of the interesting projects that showcase my proficiency in SQL, covering tasks from creating tables to conducting exploratory data analysis.
Projects Overview:

## [1) Banking Campaign Analysis](https://github.com/HlabirwaM/My-SQL-Projects/blob/main/bankcampaign.sql)

In this comprehensive project, I showcase my proficiency in SQL and data analysis by delving into the intricacies of a dataset related to the direct marketing campaign of a prominent Portuguese banking institution. The focal point of this campaign was telephone-based outreach, often requiring multiple contacts with the same client. The overarching goal was to determine whether clients would subscribe ('yes') or not ('no') to a specific financial product â€“ the bank term deposit. This dataset was published on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prakharrathi25/banking-dataset-marketing-targets) by Prakhar Rathi.

### Key Highlights:

*  Table Creation: The project commences with the creation of the 'bank' table in PostgreSQL pgAdmin, laying the groundwork for a thorough exploration of the data.

* Demographic Analysis: I conduct a meticulous analysis of the clientele, unraveling insights into age groups, marital status, education levels, and job titles. This exploration offers a nuanced understanding of the diverse customer segments targeted by the marketing campaigns.

* Financial Behavior: The analysis extends to comprehending financial behaviors, examining defaults, housing loans, and existing loans among clients. This scrutiny provides valuable insights into the financial landscape that influences subscription decisions.

* Campaign Outcomes: The project culminates in a detailed examination of campaign outcomes, elucidating the number of positive responses ('yes') and negative responses ('no'). This section also explores the impact of communication methods and the number of contacts on the campaign outcomes.

* Demographic Influence on Outcomes: The project delves into the correlation between demographic factors (marital status, education, job title, age groups) and campaign outcomes. This nuanced analysis unveils patterns and trends that aid in understanding how these demographics influence subscription decisions.

### Demonstrated Skills:

* SQL Proficiency: The project showcases my adeptness in utilizing SQL for data manipulation, extraction, and analysis, underscoring the importance of SQL in extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through meticulous exploration of the dataset, I bring forth valuable insights into customer behavior, preferences, and the effectiveness of marketing campaigns.

* Visualization with PowerBI: Complementing the SQL analysis, I present a PowerBI Dashboard available on my novypro profile. This visual representation enhances the understanding of the data, making it more accessible and actionable.

#### Data Source:

The dataset originates from the direct marketing campaign of the Portuguese banking institution. Each entry in the dataset reflects a customer interaction during this campaign, providing details on demographics, financial behavior, and the ultimate outcome of whether the client subscribed to the bank term deposit. The dataset's structure enables a granular examination of the factors influencing customer decisions, making it a valuable resource for understanding the dynamics of marketing efforts in the banking sector.

## [2) Hotel Bookings and Cancellation Analysis ](https://github.com/HlabirwaM/My-SQL-Projects/blob/main/hotelanalysis.sql)

In this project, I leverage my SQL and data analysis skills to perform exploratory data analysis on a simulated hotel named AB11, utilizing data from Kaggle provided by [Youssef Aboelwafa](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/youssefaboelwafa/hotel-booking-cancellation-prediction). The primary objective is to gain insights into the booking and cancellation patterns of clients.

### Key Highlights:

 *  Table Creation: I start the project by creating the bookings table in PostgreSQL pgAdmin, setting the foundation for subsequent analyses.
 *  Data Exploration: The analysis dives into various aspects, including identifying months with the highest booking and cancellation activities.
 *  Room and Meal Preferences: I explore preferences for room types and meal options among hotel clients.
 *  Client Data Updates:
 *  The project covers updating client data and identifying loyal customers who might be eligible for incentives.

### Demonstrated Skills:

 *   Competency in key SQL query commands
 *   Exploration of complex datasets to extract meaningful insights.

### PowerBI Dashboard:
 *  For enhanced visualization, I have created a [PowerBI Dashboard](https://www.novypro.com/project/ab11-hotel-dashboard), available on my novypro profile. The dashboard complements the SQL analysis by providing a visual representation of the data.

Please feel free to explore the SQL analysis, review the PowerBI Dashboards, and reach out for discussions and comments. Your feedback is highly appreciated!
